# Max Flow Visualizer

**Live Demo**: [https://maxflowgraphvisualizer.netlify.app/](https://maxflowgraphvisualizer.netlify.app/)

An interactive web-based visualization tool for maximum flow algorithms, built to enhance understanding of network flow concepts from Discrete Mathematics II.

## Purpose

This project was developed as a personal learning tool during my Discrete Mathematics II course at university. The goal was to create an interactive visualization that would help me (and potentially other students) better understand how different maximum flow algorithms work by seeing them in action step-by-step.

**Try it now**: Visit [maxflowgraphvisualizer.netlify.app](https://maxflowgraphvisualizer.netlify.app/) to start exploring!

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Input**: Create flow networks using a simple text format
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Compare different approaches to solving max flow problems
  - Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (DFS-based)
  - Edmonds-Karp Algorithm (BFS-based)
  - Dinic's Algorithm (Level graph approach)
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch algorithms progress one step at a time
- **Animated Playback**: See the full algorithm execution with adjustable speed
- **Real-time Statistics**: Track steps, execution time, and current maximum flow
- **Path Highlighting**: Visual feedback showing augmenting paths as they're discovered

## How to Use

Visit the [live demo](https://maxflowgraphvisualizer.netlify.app/) and follow these steps:

### Graph Input Format

Define your flow network using this simple text format in the input area:

```
s
t
a
b
sa:10
ab:5
bt:8
st:15
```

- Single characters on their own lines define nodes
- Format `XY:capacity` defines an edge from node X to node Y with given capacity
- Source node must be named 's' and sink node must be named 't'

### Example Networks to Try

**Simple Network:**
```
s
t
a
sa:20
at:10
st:10
```

**More Complex Network:**
```
s
t
a
b
c
sa:16
sb:10
ac:12
bc:4
bt:10
ct:20
```

**Challenge Network:**
```
s
t
a
b
c
d
sa:10
sb:8
ac:5
ad:8
bc:3
bd:2
cd:5
ct:10
dt:8
```

### Controls

- **Load Graph**: Parse and visualize your input network
- **Clear**: Reset the visualization
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose between Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, or Dinic's
- **Solve**: Run the complete algorithm instantly
- **Play/Pause**: Animate the algorithm step-by-step
- **Step**: Advance one step at a time
- **Speed Slider**: Adjust animation speed (0.5x to 3x)

## Learning Objectives

Through building and using this visualizer, I gained deeper understanding of:

- **Graph Theory Concepts**: Flow networks, augmenting paths, residual graphs
- **Algorithm Design Patterns**: DFS vs BFS approaches, level graphs
- **Complexity Analysis**: How different algorithms perform on various network structures
- **Implementation Details**: Converting theoretical algorithms into working code
- **Data Structures**: Graph representation, path finding, state management
